Pullup resistors are used for making sure floating wires that are connected to the pico (ones that aren't always part of a circuit depending on the state of other things) have consistent behavior. Pull-up resistors mean that the microcontroller is always trying to feed electrons into the wires—the floating wires are relatively high voltage, until the thing that is being toggled by some other part of the system to connect the floating wires in a circuit connects the floating wires to ground.
